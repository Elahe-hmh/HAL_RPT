# Growth model with steady state diffusion

In this model, we are going to approximate the oxygen and glucose diffusio
with steady states. In other words, we assume
$$\dot{u} = D \Delta u - \alpha u.$$

The to calculate the steady state, we set $\dot{u} = 0$, which leads to an exponential 
steady state distribution. More on this on the lab report notes.
